This repository contains my daily Codewars DSA solutions. Problems are organized by difficulty, and each file contains the question (as a comment) and my code.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `easy/` â€“ Beginner-friendly problems
- `medium/` â€“ Intermediate challenges
- `hard/` â€“ Advanced problems

Each file is named after the question and includes:

I solve **one problem every day** and update this repo regularly.
