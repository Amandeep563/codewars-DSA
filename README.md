# Codewars DSA Solutions

This repository contains my daily Codewars DSA solutions. Problems are organized by difficulty, and each file contains the question (as a comment) and my code.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `easy/` – Beginner-friendly problems
- `medium/` – Intermediate challenges
- `hard/` – Advanced problems

Each file is named after the question and includes:

- The question description as a comment
- The solution code

## 🚀 My Progress

I solve **one problem every day** and update this repo regularly.
